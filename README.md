# Data-Visualization-Bolton-Dataset
This is the Data Visualization I have created for the data set provided by Bolton startup Internship. The first set contains meta-data (explanation of what the data is about). The second set contains performance ratings received by each employee. The third set contains happiness scorecards filled by the employees.
